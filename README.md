```
.length will review the length of a sentence inside ""
```

#Comments
```
// is for comments  
```

#Dialogs
```
If you wanna open a dialog and receive an answer from the user, here's the answer:
confirm("Any text to accept");
```

#Print something
```
If you wanna print something, here's the solution:
console.log()
```

#Logical Operators
```
> Greater than
< Less than
<= Less than or equal to
>= Greater than or equal to
=== Equal to
!== Not equal to
```

#Modulo operations...
```
if we do 23 % 10, we divide 23 by 10 which equals 2 with 3 left over. So 23 % 10 evaluates to 3.
```

#Substring
```
"some word".substring(x, y) where x is where you start chopping and y is where you finish chopping the original string.
```

#Variables
```
Code:

var varName = data;

Example:

a. var myName = "Leng";
b. var myAge = 30;
c. var isOdd = true;
```

#Functions
```
A function takes in inputs, does something with them, and produces an output.

Here's an example of a function:

var sayHello = function(name) {
    console.log('Hello ' + name);
};

First we declare a function using var, and then give it a name sayHello. The name should begin with a lowercase letter and the convention is to use lowerCamelCase where each word (except the first) begins with a capital letter.
Then we use the function keyword to tell the computer that you are making a function
The code in the parentheses is called a parameter. It's a placeholder word that we give a specific value when we call the function. Click "Stuck? Get a hint!" for more.
Then write your block of reusable code between { }. Every line of code in this block must end with a ;.
You can run this code by "calling" the function, like this:

sayHello("Emily");
Calling this function will print out Hello Emily.
```

#Loops using for
```
for (var i = 1; i < 11; i = i + 1) {
    /* your code here */;
}

Every for loop makes use of a counting variable. Here, our variable is called i (but it can have any name). The variable has many roles. The first part of the for loop tells the computer to start with a value of 1 for i. It does this by declaring the variable called i and giving it a value of 1.

When the for loop executes the code in the code block—the bit between { }—it does so by starting off where i = 1.
```

#Loops using while
```
The while loop is ideal when you want to use a loop, but you don't know how many times you'll have to execute that loop.
T
he syntax looks like this:

while(condition){
    // Do something!
}
```

#Arrays
```
a. store lists of data
b. can store different data types at the same time
c. are ordered so the position of each piece of data is fixed

Example:

var names = ["Mao","Gandhi","Mandela"];

var sizes = [4, 6, 3, 2, 1, 9];

var mixed = [34, "candy", "blue", 11];
Syntax:
var arrayName = [data, data, data];

Any time you see data surrounded by [ ], it is an array.
```
